# Tennis-Central <sub>(v.9)</sub>


## What is Tennis-Central?
   In a nut shell Tennis-Central is web based application that helps match tennis players with other players of similar skills for either matches and/or practice sessions. 

### The Problem
   It can be challenging to find new tennis partners with similar skill levels, availability and interests beyond your existing circles of tennis friends/partners.
Tennis players typically show up to the court to play their match and then leave immediately after their match. So there isn't a easy and convenient way to meet other
tennis players unless you belong to a tennis club or a tennis league (aka "social club") or you just happen to the social butterfly type. And frankly most players don't
want to pay expensive dues to join a private tennis club or pay the fees for joining a formal tennis league and then be "fixed" to play at that leagues match times. 
They just want to play/practice with other players of similar skill level when they want to play. 

### The Solution
   Tennis Central is designed to address these challenges by leveraging the power of the web in combination with a web based application that is specifically designed
   to connect Tennis Players with similar skills, interest and availability. 

Here are some of the key features of the Tennis-Central web based application that make it an ideal solution for many players: 

### Key Features
  * **Find-A-Partner search** 
  
     Is a powerful search feature that allows a user to find a partner based amongst other Tennis-Central users on a number of key criteria including: Skill level (based on NTRP rating), availability, proximity from your location, gender, 
  type of match (single, doubles, mixed doubles), gender preference and session goals/interest (e.g., match play, just practice/drills, both). 
  * **Partner List** 
  
     Provides a simple but effect way to create and manage a list of your Tennis-Central partners. Partner contact information can be added to each partner entry making it easy
  to contact the partner. 
  * **Player Messaging**
  
     Gives you a quick and easy way to send a prospectiveor an existing partner an email message. This makes it easy to schedule matches. 
  * **Player Profile** 
  
     Allows the user to enter and retain key information that they might typically use in their Find-A-Partner searches so that they don't have to repeated have to 
  re-enter search criteria on each Find-A-Partner search. A good example would be your availability to play. It's likely that your availability doesn't change very 
  often. Rather than re-entering your availability each time you submit a Find-A-Partner search you can just select the "Load from Profile" option and your profile
  information will automatically be entered into the Find-A-Partner search form.
